# Google Shopping Ex. VAT Prices
Tamper Monkey Script to show ex. vat prices on Google Shopping

Install tamper monkey for your browser and add the contents of `shopping.js` to a new script.

Modified prices will be shown in yellow and a red warning bar will be fixed to the top of the page when the script is active.

When filters are applied, such as sorting prices from a list of stores, the DOM modifications will be lost, but click on the page and they will be re-applied.
